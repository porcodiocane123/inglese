			since that year they made smarter calculator.
		</p>

			had an LCD display, i.e. liquid crystal display or had a VFD display, i.e. a bright
			display, in 1980 the calculator was defined as a mini computer, 
			given that the his name was Computer Calculator.
		</p>
		<h2>Date of Invention</h2>
		<p>
			In reality the first calculator was created in the early 1960s. 
			Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, but the problem of these things 
			was the battery life, because Led panel  wasted a bunch of battery.
			Later, in the 1980s, the smartest calculator ever was introduced,
			that could resist enough time to be used independently.
		</p>
		<h2>Purpose of Use</h2>
		<p>
			It was used from math calculation to a daily use.
		</p>
		<h2>Price and Popularity</h2>
		<p>
			The pocket calculator, although it is a very comfortable object, is a device that,
			sooner or later, is destined to become extinct. The increasingly accelerated arrival
			of modern digital telephones, in fact, is slowly leading disappearance.
			Despite this, years ago, especially in the 80s, it was widely used by everyone,
			given its value: from young students to ordinary people.
			Its price, in fact, varied between 20 and 30 euros which, converted to the
			currency of the time, corresponded to 38725 lire.
		</p>
		<h2>Age of Those Use it and Time it Was Used</h2>
		<p>
			The pocket calculator was used extensively in high school by kids who chose a more
			math-based school. Others who used it were families to do quick calculations 
			since normal calculators were much larger and more difficult to use.
		</p>
		<h2>Color</h2>
		<p>
			It had very classic colors like black, white and grey.
			Very colorful things were not appreciated at the time, so those colors were not used.

		<h2>Intervew</h2>
		<p>
			Here is a small interview of those who really lived the golden years of this
			wonderful object.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>What was special about this object?</strong><br>
			"The pocket calculator, at the time of its release, was unknown
			to everyone and was a novelty. 
			It was this latter factor that made yes that became famous all over the world.</li>
			<li><strong>In what age did you received these device?</strong><br>
			I remember that for us students the calculator was essential: it helped
			us in the calculations and we could not do without it.</li>
			<li><strong>How long have you used this item?</strong><br>
			But then, over time, we realized that we could no longer do calculations
			in autonomous way. It was from that moment on,
			that I decided to use it in a more suitable way".</li>
